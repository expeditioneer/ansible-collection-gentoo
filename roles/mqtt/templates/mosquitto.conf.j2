# Security
# =================================================================

# If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their
# clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default,
# all clients may connect.
# For example, setting "secure-" here would mean a client "secure-
# client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn't.
#clientid_prefixes

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to
# false then a password file should be created (see the
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access.
#
# Defaults to false, unless there are no listeners defined in the configuration
# file, in which case it is set to true, but connections are only allowed from
# the local machine.
#allow_anonymous false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Default authentication and topic access control
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
# offers very little in the way of security.
#
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options. If a plugin is used as well as
# password_file, the plugin check will be made first.
password_file {{ mosquitto_configuration_dir }}/pwfile

# Access may also be controlled using a pre-shared-key file. This requires
# TLS-PSK support and a listener configured to use it. The file should be text
# lines in the format:
# identity:key
# The key should be in hexadecimal format without a leading "0x".
# If an plugin is used as well, the plugin check will be made first.
#psk_file

# Control access to topics on the broker using an access control list
# file. If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will
# have access.
# If the first character of a line of the ACL file is a # it is treated as a
# comment.
# Topic access is added with lines of the format:
#
# topic [read|write|readwrite|deny] <topic>
#
# The access type is controlled using "read", "write", "readwrite" or "deny".
# This parameter is optional (unless <topic> contains a space character) - if
# not given then the access is read/write.  <topic> can contain the + or #
# wildcards as in subscriptions.
#
# The "deny" option can used to explicity deny access to a topic that would
# otherwise be granted by a broader read/write/readwrite statement. Any "deny"
# topics are handled before topics that grant read/write access.
#
# The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
# allow_anonymous is true. User specific topic ACLs are added after a
# user line as follows:
#
# user <username>
#
# The username referred to here is the same as in password_file. It is
# not the clientid.
#
#
# If is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the
# topic. The patterns available for substition are:
#
# %c to match the client id of the client
# %u to match the username of the client
#
# The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy.
#
# The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the
# keyword.
# Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously
# been given.
#
# If using bridges with usernames and ACLs, connection messages can be allowed
# with the following pattern:
# pattern write $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
#
# pattern [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
#
# Example:
#
# pattern write sensor/%u/data
#
# If an plugin is used as well as acl_file, the plugin check will be
# made first.
#acl_file

# External authentication and topic access plugin options
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# External authentication and access control can be supported with the
# plugin option. This is a path to a loadable plugin. See also the
# plugin_opt_* options described below.
#
# The plugin option can be specified multiple times to load multiple
# plugins. The plugins will be processed in the order that they are specified
# here. If the plugin option is specified alongside either of
# password_file or acl_file then the plugin checks will be made first.
#
# If the per_listener_settings option is false, the plugin will be apply to all
# listeners. If per_listener_settings is true, then the plugin will apply to
# the current listener being defined only.
#
# This option is also available as `auth_plugin`, but this use is deprecated
# and will be removed in the future.
#
#plugin

# If the plugin option above is used, define options to pass to the
# plugin here as described by the plugin instructions. All options named
# using the format plugin_opt_* will be passed to the plugin, for example:
#
# This option is also available as `auth_opt_*`, but this use is deprecated
# and will be removed in the future.

# plugin_opt_db_host
# plugin_opt_db_port

# =================================================================
# Bridges
# =================================================================

# A bridge is a way of connecting multiple MQTT brokers together.
# Create a new bridge using the "connection" option as described below. Set
# options for the bridges using the remaining parameters. You must specify the
# address and at least one topic to subscribe to.
#
# Each connection must have a unique name.
#
# The address line may have multiple host address and ports specified. See
# below in the round_robin description for more details on bridge behaviour if
# multiple addresses are used. Note that if you use an IPv6 address, then you
# are required to specify a port.
#
# The direction that the topic will be shared can be chosen by
# specifying out, in or both, where the default value is out.
# The QoS level of the bridged communication can be specified with the next
# topic option. The default QoS level is 0, to change the QoS the topic
# direction must also be given.
#
# The local and remote prefix options allow a topic to be remapped when it is
# bridged to/from the remote broker. This provides the ability to place a topic
# tree in an appropriate location.
#
# For more details see the mosquitto.conf man page.
#
# Multiple topics can be specified per connection, but be careful
# not to create any loops.
#
# If you are using bridges with cleansession set to false (the default), then
# you may get unexpected behaviour from incoming topics if you change what
# topics you are subscribing to. This is because the remote broker keeps the
# subscription for the old topic. If you have this problem, connect your bridge
# with cleansession set to true, then reconnect with cleansession set to false
# as normal.
#connection <name>
#address <host>[:<port>] [<host>[:<port>]]
#topic <topic> [[[out | in | both] qos-level] local-prefix remote-prefix]

# If you need to have the bridge connect over a particular network interface,
# use bridge_bind_address to tell the bridge which local IP address the socket
# should bind to, e.g. `bridge_bind_address 192.168.1.10`
#bridge_bind_address

# If a bridge has topics that have "out" direction, the default behaviour is to
# send an unsubscribe request to the remote broker on that topic. This means
# that changing a topic direction from "in" to "out" will not keep receiving
# incoming messages. Sending these unsubscribe requests is not always
# desirable, setting bridge_attempt_unsubscribe to false will disable sending
# the unsubscribe request.
#bridge_attempt_unsubscribe true

# Set the version of the MQTT protocol to use with for this bridge. Can be one
# of mqttv50, mqttv311 or mqttv31. Defaults to mqttv311.
#bridge_protocol_version mqttv311

# Set the clean session variable for this bridge.
# When set to true, when the bridge disconnects for any reason, all
# messages and subscriptions will be cleaned up on the remote
# broker. Note that with cleansession set to true, there may be a
# significant amount of retained messages sent when the bridge
# reconnects after losing its connection.
# When set to false, the subscriptions and messages are kept on the
# remote broker, and delivered when the bridge reconnects.
#cleansession false

# Set the amount of time a bridge using the lazy start type must be idle before
# it will be stopped. Defaults to 60 seconds.
#idle_timeout 60

# Set the keepalive interval for this bridge connection, in
# seconds.
#keepalive_interval 60

# Set the clientid to use on the local broker. If not defined, this defaults to
# 'local.<clientid>'. If you are bridging a broker to itself, it is important
# that local_clientid and clientid do not match.
#local_clientid

# If set to true, publish notification messages to the local and remote brokers
# giving information about the state of the bridge connection. Retained
# messages are published to the topic $SYS/broker/connection/<clientid>/state
# unless the notification_topic option is used.
# If the message is 1 then the connection is active, or 0 if the connection has
# failed.
# This uses the last will and testament feature.
#notifications true

# Choose the topic on which notification messages for this bridge are
# published. If not set, messages are published on the topic
# $SYS/broker/connection/<clientid>/state
#notification_topic

# Set the client id to use on the remote end of this bridge connection. If not
# defined, this defaults to 'name.hostname' where name is the connection name
# and hostname is the hostname of this computer.
# This replaces the old "clientid" option to avoid confusion. "clientid"
# remains valid for the time being.
#remote_clientid

# Set the password to use when connecting to a broker that requires
# authentication. This option is only used if remote_username is also set.
# This replaces the old "password" option to avoid confusion. "password"
# remains valid for the time being.
#remote_password

# Set the username to use when connecting to a broker that requires
# authentication.
# This replaces the old "username" option to avoid confusion. "username"
# remains valid for the time being.
#remote_username

# Set the amount of time a bridge using the automatic start type will wait
# until attempting to reconnect.
# This option can be configured to use a constant delay time in seconds, or to
# use a backoff mechanism based on "Decorrelated Jitter", which adds a degree
# of randomness to when the restart occurs.
#
# Set a constant timeout of 20 seconds:
# restart_timeout 20
#
# Set backoff with a base (start value) of 10 seconds and a cap (upper limit) of
# 60 seconds:
# restart_timeout 10 30
#
# Defaults to jitter with a base of 5 and cap of 30
#restart_timeout 5 30

# If the bridge has more than one address given in the address/addresses
# configuration, the round_robin option defines the behaviour of the bridge on
# a failure of the bridge connection. If round_robin is false, the default
# value, then the first address is treated as the main bridge connection. If
# the connection fails, the other secondary addresses will be attempted in
# turn. Whilst connected to a secondary bridge, the bridge will periodically
# attempt to reconnect to the main bridge until successful.
# If round_robin is true, then all addresses are treated as equals. If a
# connection fails, the next address will be tried and if successful will
# remain connected until it fails
#round_robin false

# Set the start type of the bridge. This controls how the bridge starts and
# can be one of three types: automatic, lazy and once. Note that RSMB provides
# a fourth start type "manual" which isn't currently supported by mosquitto.
#
# "automatic" is the default start type and means that the bridge connection
# will be started automatically when the broker starts and also restarted
# after a short delay (30 seconds) if the connection fails.
#
# Bridges using the "lazy" start type will be started automatically when the
# number of queued messages exceeds the number set with the "threshold"
# parameter. It will be stopped automatically after the time set by the
# "idle_timeout" parameter. Use this start type if you wish the connection to
# only be active when it is needed.
#
# A bridge using the "once" start type will be started automatically when the
# broker starts but will not be restarted if the connection fails.
#start_type automatic

# Set the number of messages that need to be queued for a bridge with lazy
# start type to be restarted. Defaults to 10 messages.
# Must be less than max_queued_messages.
#threshold 10

# If try_private is set to true, the bridge will attempt to indicate to the
# remote broker that it is a bridge not an ordinary client. If successful, this
# means that loop detection will be more effective and that retained messages
# will be propagated correctly. Not all brokers support this feature so it may
# be necessary to set try_private to false if your bridge does not connect
# properly.
#try_private true

# Some MQTT brokers do not allow retained messages. MQTT v5 gives a mechanism
# for brokers to tell clients that they do not support retained messages, but
# this is not possible for MQTT v3.1.1 or v3.1. If you need to bridge to a
# v3.1.1 or v3.1 broker that does not support retained messages, set the
# bridge_outgoing_retain option to false. This will remove the retain bit on
# all outgoing messages to that bridge, regardless of any other setting.
#bridge_outgoing_retain true

# If you wish to restrict the size of messages sent to a remote bridge, use the
# bridge_max_packet_size option. This sets the maximum number of bytes for
# the total message, including headers and payload.
# Note that MQTT v5 brokers may provide their own maximum-packet-size property.
# In this case, the smaller of the two limits will be used.
# Set to 0 for "unlimited".
#bridge_max_packet_size 0


# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Certificate based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Either bridge_cafile or bridge_capath must be defined to enable TLS support
# for this bridge.
# bridge_cafile defines the path to a file containing the
# Certificate Authority certificates that have signed the remote broker
# certificate.
# bridge_capath defines a directory that will be searched for files containing
# the CA certificates. For bridge_capath to work correctly, the certificate
# files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run "openssl rehash
# <path to capath>" each time you add/remove a certificate.
#bridge_cafile
#bridge_capath


# If the remote broker has more than one protocol available on its port, e.g.
# MQTT and WebSockets, then use bridge_alpn to configure which protocol is
# requested. Note that WebSockets support for bridges is not yet available.
#bridge_alpn

# When using certificate based encryption, bridge_insecure disables
# verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. This can be
# useful when testing initial server configurations, but makes it possible for
# a malicious third party to impersonate your server through DNS spoofing, for
# example. Use this option in testing only. If you need to resort to using this
# option in a production environment, your setup is at fault and there is no
# point using encryption.
#bridge_insecure false

# Path to the PEM encoded client certificate, if required by the remote broker.
#bridge_certfile

# Path to the PEM encoded client private key, if required by the remote broker.
#bridge_keyfile

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# PSK based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Pre-shared-key encryption provides an alternative to certificate based
# encryption. A bridge can be configured to use PSK with the bridge_identity
# and bridge_psk options. These are the client PSK identity, and pre-shared-key
# in hexadecimal format with no "0x". Only one of certificate and PSK based
# encryption can be used on one
# bridge at once.
